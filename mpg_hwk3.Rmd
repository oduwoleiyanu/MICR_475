```{r}
library(tidyverse)
head(mpg)
# I want to investigate the effect of car class on their mileage

ggplot(data = mpg) +
geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class))

#conclusion: 2 seater cars are the outliers because they have small body sizes but large engines. Cars with larger engines and larger body like the SUV have higher higher mileage
