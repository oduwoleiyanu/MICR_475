**Comparing bad and good plots**


**Figure 1(bad plot) explanation**: The plot is about in Silico Analysis of 𝛽-Galactosidases Primary and Secondary Structure in relation to Temperature Adaptation. The x axis is the amino acid while the y axis is the amino acid distribution. A bargraph was used for the plot

Figure 1(bad plot): Percentage composition of amino acid in 𝛽-galactosidase from some thermophilic, psychrophilic, and mesophilic microorganisms. Error bar represents standard error (SE = SD/√𝑛, where 𝑛 is number of sample and SD is standard deviation). ∗∗Significative at a level of 1% of probability (𝑃 < 0.01). ∗Significative at a level of 5% of probability (0.01 ≤ 𝑃 < 0.05). ∗∗∗Nonsignificative (𝑃 ≥ 0.05)

**Why it is a badplot**:
The axes are not descriptive of the plot content
b)The visualization chosen for the plot makes comparison between the bars difficult because the colors can not easily be distinguishable
c)The  plot does not exhibit multi-variation, it may be hard to estabilish relationships with the whole 20 amino acids of three different categories.
Suggestion: Breaking down the plots into facets to improve the visualization and understanding of the contents

```{r}
library(png)
plot_1 <- readPNG("iyanubadplot.png")
plot.new()
rasterImage(plot_1, 0,0,1,1)
```
**Figure 2(good plot)**
The plot is about comparing mutagenesis and simulations as tools for
identifying functionally important sequence changes
for protein thermal adaptation. The x axis the fraction of amino acid (%) while the y axis is the thermostability

**Figure explanation**: Overall and region-specific variation in different categories of amino acids of 26 orthologs of molluscan cMDHs as a function of enzyme stability (rate
of denaturation at 40 °C for genus Haliotis, Adamussium colbecki, and Laternula elliptica and at 42.5 °C for all other species). The fitted linear regression line is
shown as a solid line when P < 0.05; a dashed line is used when the regression was nonsignificant. Amino acid categories were charged (DEKR), weakly
hydrophobic/polar (AGNQSTHY), and hydrophobic (LVWIFMPC) (33). (A–C) Overall variation in amino acid composition throughout the protein structure, (D–
F) variation in surface composition, (G–I) variation in composition of the intermediate depth region, and (J–L) variation in composition of the core region of
the protein. Variation in (M–P) proline and (Q–T) glycine content in different regions of the enzyme

**Why is it a goodplot**:
a)The axes are descriptive of the plot content.
b) The plot exhibits mutli_variation unlike the other plot 
c) Comparison can easily be done on this graph because it explicity simplifies the overall relationship between each amino acids and thermostability.
